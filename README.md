Purpose:

	The idea behind this project is a energy managing solution as a lightweight backend service. It's manufacturer independent, cloud independend, and gives the user decide full control and the choice which UI to use.

	It can be used for displaying purposes (i. e. you want to see how much power is consumed in your flat or feeded by your solar premise.). It can be used to manage the power consumption according to the availability of power (i. e. to set the max power of your car charger when your meters feeds in). Or to provide an interface for other managing tools, which don't support your meter/inverter or whatever.
